Website Deployment, Embedding Generation & Vector Storage Goal: Create a pipeline that crawls the deployed book website, extracts text from all pages, generates embeddings using Cohere models, and stores them in a Qdrant Cloud vector database. Scope: - Accept website base URL(s) of the Docusaurus-deployed book. - Crawl and extract clean text from all pages (no HTML noise). - Chunk content using optimal token-based strategy. - Generate embeddings using Cohere Embed v3 (or latest embedding model). - Create Qdrant collection with appropriate parameters (vector size, distance metric, metadata). - Upload all embeddings + metadata to Qdrant. - Validate successful ingestion with sample queries.
